Welcome to N- I did this in my free time so don't expect 
To many changes. Here is the list that has changed:

A function called "ran_math" was defined to generate random numbers within a given range.
A function called "showf" was defined to behave similarly to "printf" and print messages to the console.
Macros were defined to replace the use of "true" and "false" with "yes" and "no", respectively.
